Thank you for participating in our language learning experiment! 

We are investigating whether different methods of learning a new language affect how easy it is to learn the language's grammar, and our results could contribute to making better second language learning programs. You were in the group that did a speaking task during the active learning part of the experiment; Other participants had different kinds of learning experiences. 

In case you are curious, the language you learned was made up in order to make sure that no one knew the language before they had participated in the experiment. 

Please get the experimenter so that they can start the language background questionnaire.
